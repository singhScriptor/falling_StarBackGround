- Style the stars and their animations.
- Ensure the footer is positioned at the bottom of the page.
- Apply responsive design to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript (JS) adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage. It is used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and apply styles and animations dynamically. In this project, JavaScript is used to:
